# Verification Guidelines

## Accuracy Rules
- **Always verify before stating facts** - Check code/docs before claiming something exists or works
- **State confidence level when uncertain** - Use "Confidence: Low/Medium/High" or "Unknown" when unsure
- **Don't assume user correctness** - Verify user statements against actual codebase
