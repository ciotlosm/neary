# Implementation Plan: Station Vehicle List

## Overview

Implement the station vehicle list feature by creating a new hook for vehicle filtering logic, a new component for displaying vehicles, and enhancing the existing station list to support expandable vehicle sections. The implementation follows clean architecture principles with components under 150 lines and leverages existing stores and services.

## Notes

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional and can be skipped for faster MVP
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Property tests validate universal correctness properties using fast-check
- Unit tests validate specific examples and edge cases
- Components must stay under 150 lines following clean architecture principles
- Feature integrates with existing smart station filtering behavior
