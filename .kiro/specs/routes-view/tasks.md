# Implementation Plan: Routes View

## Overview

This implementation plan converts the Routes view design into discrete coding tasks that replace the existing Vehicles view with a comprehensive route display system. Each task builds incrementally on the previous ones, following the established architectural patterns while adapting them for route data display.

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Create RouteList component
  - Create `src/components/features/lists/RouteList.tsx` component
  - Implement route display with short name, long name, description, color indicators, and route type badges
  - Use Material-UI List components following the VehicleList pattern
  - Handle empty state display when no routes are available
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5_

- [ ]* 1.1 Write property test for RouteList component
  - **Property 1: Route display completeness**
  - **Validates: Requirements 2.1, 2.2, 2.3**

- [x] 2. Create RouteView component
  - Create `src/components/features/views/RouteView.tsx` component
  - Implement loading, error, and success states using the VehicleView pattern
  - Connect to useRouteStore and useConfigStore hooks
  - Add automatic route loading on component mount and configuration changes
  - Include retry functionality for error states
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ]* 2.1 Write property test for configuration-driven loading
  - **Property 3: Configuration-driven loading**
  - **Validates: Requirements 3.2, 5.1, 5.2**

- [ ]* 2.2 Write property test for state handling consistency
  - **Property 4: State handling consistency**
  - **Validates: Requirements 1.4, 3.4**

- [ ]* 2.3 Write property test for error recovery behavior
  - **Property 5: Error recovery behavior**
  - **Validates: Requirements 4.4, 4.5**

- [x] 3. Update navigation system
  - Modify `src/main.tsx` to render RouteView instead of VehicleView for navigation index 1
  - Update `src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx` to change "Vehicles" label to "Routes"
  - Ensure navigation icon and functionality remain consistent
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

- [ ]* 3.1 Write unit tests for navigation integration
  - Test that RouteView is rendered when navigation value is 1
  - Test that VehicleView is no longer rendered as primary interface
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

- [ ] 4. Checkpoint - Ensure all tests pass
  - Ensure all tests pass, ask the user if questions arise.

- [ ]* 4.1 Write property test for data integrity preservation
  - **Property 2: Data integrity preservation**
  - **Validates: Requirements 2.4, 3.3**

- [ ] 5. Integration and final testing
  - Verify RouteView integrates properly with existing stores and configuration
  - Test loading behavior with real API configuration
  - Ensure error handling works correctly across all scenarios
  - Validate that route colors and types display correctly
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 3.5, 5.4_

- [ ]* 5.1 Write integration tests for complete route flow
  - Test end-to-end route loading and display
  - Test configuration changes trigger route reloading
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 3.5, 5.4_

- [ ] 6. Final checkpoint - Ensure all tests pass
  - Ensure all tests pass, ask the user if questions arise.

## Notes

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional and can be skipped for faster MVP
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Checkpoints ensure incremental validation
- Property tests validate universal correctness properties
- Unit tests validate specific examples and edge cases
- The implementation follows the established VehicleView patterns for consistency
