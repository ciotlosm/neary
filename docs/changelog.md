## Breaking Changes

### December 2024
- **Removed pattern-based schedules** - Apps relying on fake schedule data will need updates
- **Changed route mapping logic** - Now uses route labels for CTP Cluj integration

## Migration Guide

### From Pattern-Based to Real Data
If you were using the old pattern-based schedule system:

1. **Update API calls** - Use new service methods that fetch real data
2. **Handle confidence levels** - New system provides confidence indicators
3. **Test with real routes** - Verify your routes work with official CTP Cluj data

### Route Mapping Updates
If you were using route IDs directly:

```typescript
// OLD: Using route ID for everything
const routeId = "40";
const schedule = await getSchedule(routeId);

// NEW: Use appropriate identifier for each service
const routeId = "40"; // For Tranzy API
const routeLabel = "42"; // For CTP Cluj (user-facing)
const schedule = await getOfficialSchedule(routeLabel);
```

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations
- **Limited route coverage** - Not all CTP Cluj routes have live tracking
- **Schedule accuracy** - Official schedules may not reflect real-time delays
- **API rate limits** - Tranzy API has usage limitations

### Planned Improvements
- **Enhanced caching** - Better offline support and performance
- **More data sources** - Additional transit agencies beyond CTP Cluj
- **Push notifications** - Alerts for favorite routes
- **Route planning** - Multi-modal trip planning

### December 15, 2024 - Fixed Favorite Buses Data Issue

#### 🐛 **FIXED: Favorite Buses Not Showing Data**
- **Root Cause**: `liveVehicleService` was filtering out vehicles without `tripId`
- **Issue**: Overly restrictive filtering prevented vehicles from being cached for favorites
- **Solution**: Removed `tripId` requirement, now includes all vehicles with valid `routeId`

#### ✅ **Changes Made:**
- **LiveVehicleService**: Removed `tripId` requirement for vehicle caching
- **Vehicle Filtering**: Now includes vehicles based on `routeId` only
- **Cache Population**: All route vehicles are now properly cached for favorites
- **Data Availability**: Favorite buses should now show live vehicle data again

#### 🎯 **Technical Details:**
**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
// Only cache vehicles with active trip_id
const hasActiveTripId = vehicle.tripId !== null && vehicle.tripId !== undefined;
if (!hasActiveTripId) {
  continue; // This was filtering out too many vehicles
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
// Include vehicles with route_id (trip_id is optional for favorites)
const routeId = vehicle.routeId?.toString();
if (routeId) {
  // Cache all vehicles with valid route IDs
}
```

#### 📋 **Impact:**
- **Favorite Buses**: Should now display live vehicle data correctly
- **Route Coverage**: More vehicles available for favorite route tracking
- **Real-Time Updates**: Improved data availability for user's favorite routes
- **Cache Efficiency**: Better vehicle data population in cache

This fix restores the favorite buses functionality that was broken by the concept alignment changes.
### December 15, 2024 - Fixed Null TripId Handling in Favorites

#### 🐛 **FIXED: "Route information unavailable" in Favorite Buses**
- **Root Cause**: Code was using `vehicle.tripId!` non-null assertions when `tripId` could be null
- **Issue**: Vehicles without `tripId` were causing route information processing to fail
- **Solution**: Added proper null checks for `tripId` throughout favorite bus processing

#### ✅ **Changes Made:**
- **Null Safety**: Replaced `vehicle.tripId!` with proper null checks
- **Fallback Data**: Use route mapping data when trip data is unavailable
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle vehicles without complete GTFS trip information
- **Error Prevention**: Avoid crashes when processing vehicles with null `tripId`

#### 🎯 **Technical Details:**
**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
const tripData = tripsMap.get(vehicle.tripId!); // Crash if tripId is null
const tripStopTimes = stopTimesMap.get(vehicle.tripId!) || [];
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
const tripData = vehicle.tripId ? tripsMap.get(vehicle.tripId) : null;
const tripStopTimes = vehicle.tripId ? (stopTimesMap.get(vehicle.tripId) || []) : [];
```

#### 📋 **Impact:**
- **Favorite Buses**: Should now show vehicle information instead of "Route information unavailable"
- **Data Robustness**: Handles vehicles with incomplete GTFS data gracefully
- **User Experience**: Displays available information even when some data is missing
- **Stability**: Prevents crashes from null pointer exceptions

This fix ensures favorite buses work correctly even when vehicles don't have complete trip information.
### December 15, 2024 - Corrected Vehicle Filtering Logic

#### ✅ **CORRECTED: Proper Vehicle Filtering for Favorites**
- **Clarification**: Vehicles with `trip_id` as null indicate problems and must be filtered out
- **Proper Solution**: Enhanced filtering to require both valid `trip_id` AND `route_id`
- **Data Quality**: Only cache vehicles with complete, valid GTFS information

#### 🎯 **Final Implementation:**
```typescript
// Only cache vehicles with valid trip_id AND route_id (both required for proper tracking)
const hasValidTripId = vehicle.tripId !== null && vehicle.tripId !== undefined && vehicle.tripId !== '';
const routeId = vehicle.routeId?.toString();

if (hasValidTripId && routeId) {
  // Cache only high-quality vehicles with complete data
}
```

#### 📋 **Data Quality Standards:**
- **Valid TripId Required**: Filters out vehicles with operational issues
- **Valid RouteId Required**: Ensures proper route association
- **Complete GTFS Data**: Only processes vehicles with full transit information
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to show fewer, accurate vehicles than many problematic ones

#### 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis:**
The original issue was likely that there are currently no vehicles with valid `trip_id` values for Route 42, which could indicate:
- **Operational Issues**: Route 42 vehicles may have technical problems
- **Schedule Gaps**: No active trips currently running for this route
- **API Data Issues**: Temporary problems with GTFS trip assignments

This is the correct approach - we should only show vehicles that have proper GTFS trip information, as vehicles without `trip_id` indicate operational problems.

### December 15, 2024 - Fixed Tranzy API Route ID Inconsistency

#### 🐛 **MAJOR FIX: Favorite Buses Vehicle Lookup Issue Resolved**
- **Problem**: Favorite buses showing "No real-time data available" despite vehicles existing for those routes
- **Root Cause**: Tranzy API vehicle endpoint design - vehicles use route short names in their route_id field:
  - **Routes API**: Uses internal route IDs (e.g., `route_id: 40` for `route_short_name: "42"`)
  - **Vehicles API**: Uses route short names in route_id field (e.g., `route_id: "42"`)
- **Solution**: Modified `favoriteBusService.ts` to look up vehicles using route short names

#### 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (broken): Used internal route ID for vehicle lookup
const correctedRoute = {
  id: mapping.routeId, // "40" - doesn't match vehicle route_id field
  routeName: favoriteRoute.routeName,
  longName: favoriteRoute.longName
};

// AFTER (fixed): Use route short name for vehicle lookup  
const correctedRoute = {
  id: favoriteRoute.routeName, // "42" - matches vehicle route_id field
  routeName: favoriteRoute.routeName,
  longName: favoriteRoute.longName
};
```

#### ✅ **Verification Methods:**
- **Console Logs**: Look for `🗺️ DEBUGGING: Route mapping found` with API design explanation
- **Vehicle Cache**: Check `🚌 DEBUGGING: Vehicle cache lookup results` showing populated `routesWithVehicles`
- **Route Correction**: Verify proper vehicle lookup strategy in debug logs

#### 📋 **Impact:**
- **Favorite Buses**: Now correctly display live vehicle data for configured routes
- **Route Coverage**: All routes with active vehicles should now work properly
- **API Compatibility**: Properly handles Tranzy API vehicle endpoint design
- **User Experience**: Eliminates "Route information unavailable" errors for valid routes

This fix resolves the vehicle lookup issue by understanding that the Tranzy API vehicles endpoint uses route short names in the route_id field, not internal route IDs.

### December 15, 2024 - Fixed Route ID vs Display Name Confusion

#### 🐛 **FIXED: Incorrect Use of routeName for IDs**
- **Problem**: Code was incorrectly using `routeName` for internal IDs when it should only be used for display
- **Root Cause**: Mixed up ID and display name concepts in route mapping logic
- **Solution**: Ensured `routeName` is only used for display purposes, IDs use proper route short names

#### 🔧 **Technical Fix:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect): Mixed routeName usage
const correctedRoute = {
  id: mapping.routeShortName, // Correct for vehicle lookup
  routeName: favoriteRoute.routeName, // Incorrect - using input routeName
  longName: favoriteRoute.longName
};

// AFTER (correct): Consistent route short name usage
const correctedRoute = {
  id: mapping.routeShortName, // Correct for vehicle lookup  
  routeName: mapping.routeShortName, // Correct - use mapping's route short name
  longName: mapping.routeLongName // Correct - use mapping's long name
};
```

#### ✅ **Principle Applied:**
- **IDs**: Used internally for API calls and vehicle lookups
- **routeName**: Used only for display purposes in UI
- **Consistency**: Both `id` and `routeName` now use the same route short name value
- **Data Source**: Route information comes from mapping service, not user input

#### 📋 **Impact:**
- **Data Consistency**: Route information now comes from authoritative mapping source
- **Display Accuracy**: Route names and descriptions are properly sourced from API
- **Code Clarity**: Clear separation between internal IDs and display names
- **Maintainability**: Eliminates confusion about when to use routeName vs ID

This ensures proper separation of concerns between internal route identification and user-facing display names.

### December 15, 2024 - Route Property Naming Standardization

#### 🔧 **MAJOR: Standardized Route Property Names Throughout Codebase**
- **Problem**: Inconsistent property naming across the codebase (`shortName`/`longName` vs `routeName`/`routeDesc`)
- **Solution**: Systematic renaming for consistency and clarity across all files
- **Scope**: Updated 15+ files including services, components, stores, and utilities

#### 📋 **Property Renaming Applied:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (inconsistent):
interface Route {
  shortName: string;  // Sometimes used
  longName: string;   // Sometimes used
}

// AFTER (consistent):
interface Route {
  routeName: string;  // Always used for route display names
  routeDesc: string;  // Always used for route descriptions
}
```

#### 🔧 **Files Updated:**
- **Type Definitions**: `src/types/tranzyApi.ts` - Updated core Route interface
- **Services**: `routeMappingService.ts`, `favoriteBusService.ts`, `tranzyApiService.ts`, `routePlanningService.ts`
- **Stores**: `favoriteBusStore.ts` - Updated route data structures
- **Components**: All FavoriteBuses components, Debug components
- **Utilities**: `routeUtils.ts`, `busDisplayUtils.ts` - Updated search and display logic
- **Hooks**: `useFavoriteBusManager.ts` - Updated route management logic

#### ✅ **Consistency Improvements:**
- **Route Names**: All `shortName` → `routeName` (user-facing route numbers like "42", "43B")
- **Route Descriptions**: All `longName` → `routeDesc` (full descriptions like "Piața Unirii - Mănăștur")
- **StoreRoute Types**: Added missing `id` field for proper route identification
- **API Mapping**: Consistent property usage in route mapping service
- **UI Components**: Updated all display logic to use new property names

#### 🎯 **Benefits:**
- **Code Clarity**: Clear distinction between route names and descriptions
- **Maintainability**: Consistent property names across entire codebase
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces with required fields
- **API Consistency**: Aligned with Tranzy API field naming conventions

This standardization eliminates confusion about route property usage and ensures consistent data handling throughout the application.

#### 🐛 **FIXED: Favorites View API Key Error After Route Renaming**
- **Problem**: Favorites view showed "API Key Invalid" error after route property renaming
- **Root Cause**: Missed `longName` references in critical data flow paths
- **Files Fixed**: 
  - `src/services/favoriteBusService.ts` - Updated method signatures and property references
  - `src/hooks/useFavoriteBusManager.ts` - Fixed route creation logic
  - `src/utils/busDisplayUtils.ts` - Updated route name lookup logic
  - `src/types/index.ts` - Maintained backward compatibility for `FavoriteRoute.longName`

#### ✅ **Resolution Applied:**
- Fixed all remaining `longName` → `routeDesc` references in data flow
- Updated method signatures to use consistent property names
- Maintained backward compatibility where needed
- Ensured API calls use correct property names from transformed route objects

The favorites view should now work correctly with the standardized route property names.
