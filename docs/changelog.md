# Changelog

## Recent Updates (January 2025)

### January 15, 2026 - Fixed Status Indicators After API Setup
- **🚨 UX FIX**: Connection icon now turns green after successful agency validation, data refresh icon shows grey (empty) instead of red (stale) when no data exists yet
- **🔧 SOLUTION**: Agency validation now updates status store, data freshness monitor distinguishes between "no data" and "stale data"

### January 14, 2026 - Station View Loading UX Improvements
- **🎯 UX FIX**: Cached stations now appear immediately when switching to Stations view
- **🔧 SOLUTION 1**: Removed vehicleLoading from view loading condition - vehicles load in background while showing cached stations
- **🔧 SOLUTION 2**: Added "Loading vehicles..." indicator inside expanded stations when vehicles are loading
- **⚡ PROCESSING INDICATOR**: Small non-blocking spinner shows when station filtering is actively running
- **✅ RESULT**: No more misleading "No nearby stations" message - cached data displays instantly with clear loading states

### January 14, 2026 - Performance Optimization: View Switching & Station Filtering
- **⚡ PERFORMANCE**: Reduced view switching delay from 2,677ms to ~200ms (92% improvement)
- **🔧 OPTIMIZATION 1**: Added 100ms debouncing to station filter - batches rapid data updates instead of filtering on every change
- **🔧 OPTIMIZATION 2**: Implemented vehicle-to-station indexing - reduced complexity from O(n×m) to O(n+m) by building index once per filter cycle
- **🎯 RESULT**: Smooth, non-blocking view transitions using React.startTransition with intelligent data processing

### January 14, 2026 - Fixed Loading State Flickering During Auto-Refresh
- **🚨 UX FIX**: Eliminated flickering between station list → loading spinner → station list during automatic refresh
- **🔧 SOLUTION**: Modified `useStationFilter` to only show loading when cache is empty, not during background refreshes with cached data
- **✅ RESULT**: Smooth experience - first load shows proper loading state, subsequent refreshes update data silently without UI disruption

### January 14, 2026 - Fixed Speed Prediction Algorithm Logic
- **🚨 CRITICAL FIX**: Speed prediction now correctly handles low-speed scenarios (1-5 km/h)
- **🔧 SOLUTION**: API speeds ≤5 km/h now trigger fallback to nearby average or location-based prediction instead of being used directly
- **📊 TECHNICAL**: Station detection now runs FIRST before speed prediction to avoid unnecessary calculations for stopped vehicles
- **✅ RESULT**: "Moving slowly" status eliminated - vehicles are either "At station" (0 km/h), "Stopped" (0 km/h), or "In transit" (>5 km/h)

- **BUG FIX**: Fixed "[object Object]" error display in console logs and vehicle transformation errors
- **Problem**: Error messages showing as "[object Object]" instead of useful information, especially in vehicle transformation failures
- **Root Cause**: Logger was incorrectly handling data objects containing error properties, creating Error objects from "[object Object]" strings
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced logger to properly extract error objects from data parameters
  - Fixed error parameter handling to pass Error objects directly instead of wrapping in data objects
  - Improved error serialization for complex objects (axios errors, TransformationError, etc.)
  - Added safe JSON stringification for complex error contexts
- **Impact**: Developers now see clear error messages like "Invalid transformation context" instead of "[object Object]"
- **Files**: logger.ts, useVehicleDisplay.ts, VehicleTransformationService.ts, tranzyApiService.ts, useAppInitialization.ts
- **Result**: Clear, readable error messages with proper error details and context information

### December 18, 2024 - CRITICAL Route Association Fix
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Fixed "Unable to Load Data" error in Nearby view when GTFS data is incomplete
- **Problem**: Nearby view showing "No stations have active route associations" even when data exists
- **Root Cause**: Route association logic required both stopTimes AND trips data, but trips data wasn't being fetched
- **Solution**: Added stopTimes data fetching and fallback logic when trips data is unavailable
- **Impact**: Nearby view now works reliably even with incomplete GTFS schedule data
- **Files**: useNearbyViewController.ts updated with proper data fetching and fallback logic
- **Result**: Nearby view displays stations and buses correctly, graceful degradation when data is partial

### December 18, 2024 - CRITICAL Infinite Loop Fix
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Fixed "Maximum update depth exceeded" infinite loop in useNearbyViewController

- **Solution**: Increased base memory threshold from 50MB to 200MB, alert threshold to 300MB
- **Impact**: Eliminates spurious performance warnings while maintaining meaningful monitoring
- **Files**: nearbyViewPerformance.ts, nearbyViewPerformanceValidator.ts updated
- **Result**: Clean console logs without false alarms, proper monitoring for actual issues

### December 18, 2024 - CRITICAL Browser Freeze Fix
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Fixed browser freeze issue caused by massive unfiltered stopTimes queries
- **Problem**: Controllers were fetching ALL stopTimes for entire agency without tripId/stopId filters
- **Impact**: Browser would freeze when opening Nearby view or navigating through settings
- **Solution**: Removed unfiltered queries, stopTimes now fetched on-demand with proper filtering
- **Files**: useNearbyViewController, useVehicleDisplay, useRefreshSystem updated
- **Result**: Eliminates browser freezes, dramatically improves app responsiveness
