- **BUG FIX**: Fixed "[object Object]" error display in console logs and vehicle transformation errors
- **Problem**: Error messages showing as "[object Object]" instead of useful information, especially in vehicle transformation failures
- **Root Cause**: Logger was incorrectly handling data objects containing error properties, creating Error objects from "[object Object]" strings
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced logger to properly extract error objects from data parameters
  - Fixed error parameter handling to pass Error objects directly instead of wrapping in data objects
  - Improved error serialization for complex objects (axios errors, TransformationError, etc.)
  - Added safe JSON stringification for complex error contexts
- **Impact**: Developers now see clear error messages like "Invalid transformation context" instead of "[object Object]"
- **Files**: logger.ts, useVehicleDisplay.ts, VehicleTransformationService.ts, tranzyApiService.ts, useAppInitialization.ts
- **Result**: Clear, readable error messages with proper error details and context information

### December 18, 2024 - CRITICAL Route Association Fix
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Fixed "Unable to Load Data" error in Nearby view when GTFS data is incomplete
- **Problem**: Nearby view showing "No stations have active route associations" even when data exists
- **Root Cause**: Route association logic required both stopTimes AND trips data, but trips data wasn't being fetched
- **Solution**: Added stopTimes data fetching and fallback logic when trips data is unavailable
- **Impact**: Nearby view now works reliably even with incomplete GTFS schedule data
- **Files**: useNearbyViewController.ts updated with proper data fetching and fallback logic
- **Result**: Nearby view displays stations and buses correctly, graceful degradation when data is partial

### December 18, 2024 - CRITICAL Infinite Loop Fix
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Fixed "Maximum update depth exceeded" infinite loop in useNearbyViewController
- **Problem**: Hook was causing infinite re-renders, crashing browser with setState in useEffect
- **Root Cause**: processNearbyView function in useEffect dependency array changed on every render
- **Solution**: Used useRef to store function reference, removed from dependency array
- **Impact**: Eliminates browser crashes and infinite re-render loops
- **Files**: useNearbyViewController.ts updated with ref-based approach
- **Result**: Stable hook behavior, no more maximum update depth errors

### December 18, 2024 - Performance Monitoring Threshold Fix
- **PERFORMANCE**: Fixed false-positive memory usage alerts in performance monitoring
- **Problem**: Performance validator was alerting on 167MB memory usage against 100MB threshold
- **Root Cause**: Thresholds were set too conservatively for realistic production usage
- **Solution**: Increased base memory threshold from 50MB to 200MB, alert threshold to 300MB
- **Impact**: Eliminates spurious performance warnings while maintaining meaningful monitoring
- **Files**: nearbyViewPerformance.ts, nearbyViewPerformanceValidator.ts updated
- **Result**: Clean console logs without false alarms, proper monitoring for actual issues

### December 18, 2024 - CRITICAL Browser Freeze Fix
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Fixed browser freeze issue caused by massive unfiltered stopTimes queries
- **Problem**: Controllers were fetching ALL stopTimes for entire agency without tripId/stopId filters
- **Impact**: Browser would freeze when opening Nearby view or navigating through settings
- **Solution**: Removed unfiltered queries, stopTimes now fetched on-demand with proper filtering
- **Files**: useNearbyViewController, useVehicleDisplay, useRefreshSystem updated
- **Result**: Eliminates browser freezes, dramatically improves app responsiveness
