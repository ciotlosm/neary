# Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Build & Development Issues

#### Favorite Buses Empty After Setup
**Problem**: Favorite buses section shows empty even after completing setup

**Root Cause**: Favorite bus system required home location to be set, but home/work locations are now optional

**Solution**: Updated favorite bus system with intelligent location fallback
- Removed home location requirement from favorite bus system
- Added location priority: current GPS → home → work → Cluj center default
- Favorite buses now work immediately after API key + city setup

**Prevention**: Ensure optional features don't block core functionality

#### Setup Wizard Complete Button Not Working
**Problem**: Clicking "Complete Setup" after city selection doesn't transition to main app

**Root Cause**: Setup wizard wasn't saving complete configuration - missing `refreshRate` required for `isConfigured` state

**Solution**: Added default configuration values to setup wizard
- Added `refreshRate: 30000` (30 seconds default)
- Added `staleDataThreshold: 2` (2 minutes default)
- Ensures `isConfigured` state becomes true after setup completion

**Prevention**: Always verify complete configuration requirements when updating setup flow

#### MUI Menu Fragment Warning
**Problem**: `The Menu component doesn't accept a Fragment as a child. Consider providing an array instead.`

**Root Cause**: Menu component contained React Fragments (`<>...</>`) as direct children

**Solution**: Replaced Fragment children with arrays using keys
- Changed `<>...</>` to `[<Element key="..." />, ...]` pattern
- Added proper keys to array elements for React reconciliation
- Maintained same functionality without MUI warnings

**Prevention**: Use arrays instead of Fragments when rendering multiple children in MUI components

#### Station Display Showing Duplicate Vehicles
**Problem**: Station display showing multiple duplicate entries for the same bus routes and stations

**Root Cause**: Vehicle assignment logic was showing all vehicles for each station group instead of filtering vehicles by which stations they actually serve

**Solution**: Fixed vehicle-to-station assignment logic
- Updated vehicle filtering to check which stations each vehicle's trip actually serves
- Added proper trip_id to stop_times mapping for accurate vehicle-station relationships

#### Missing Components After Checkpoint Restore
**Problem**: After restoring from a checkpoint, some FavoriteBuses components are missing, causing build errors like "Cannot find module './components/RouteTypeFilters'"

**Root Cause**: Checkpoint restore moved some files to an archive folder, but imports still reference the original locations

**Solution**: Restore missing components from git history
1. **Identify missing files** from git history:
   ```bash
   git log --name-only --oneline | head -50
   ```

2. **Restore from git history:**
   ```bash
   # Find the commit with the files
   git show COMMIT_HASH:path/to/file.tsx > /tmp/file.tsx
   cp /tmp/file.tsx src/path/to/file.tsx
   ```

3. **Key files to restore:**
   - `BusRouteMapModal.tsx` - Route map modal component
   - `RoutesList.tsx` - Routes list display
   - `RouteListItem.tsx` - Individual route item
   - `RouteTypeFilters.tsx` - Route type filtering
   - `StatusMessages.tsx` - Status message display

4. **Verify build:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

**Prevention**: Always verify that all imported components exist before committing changes
- Fixed TypeScript interface issues with LiveVehicle vs raw API response data
- Added station name deduplication to handle multiple stations with same names

**Code Changes**:
- Fixed `StationDisplay.tsx` vehicle grouping logic
- Updated type imports from `Vehicle` to `LiveVehicle`
- Fixed property access for transformed vehicle data structure
- Added `_internalDirection` field for UI display logic

**Prevention**: Always verify data relationships when displaying grouped information

#### Settings Component Export Error
**Problem**: `SyntaxError: Indirectly exported binding name 'Settings' is not found`

**Root Cause**: Conflicting named and default exports in Settings component

**Solution**: Fixed by standardizing to named exports only
- Updated `Settings.tsx` to use only named export
- Updated `index.ts` to properly re-export named export

#### Vehicle Label Discrepancy
**Problem**: Different vehicle numbers shown in tooltip vs map popup (e.g., "354" in tooltip, "Bus 223" in popup)

**Root Cause**: Inconsistent use of vehicle identifiers - tooltip used `label` field, popup used `vehicleId` field

**Solution**: Standardized to use vehicle `label` field consistently
- Updated `FavoriteBusInfo` interface to include `label` field from API
- Changed all `vehicleLabel` references to use `bus.label` instead of `bus.routeName`
- Updated map popup to show `Bus {bus.label}` with fallback to `vehicleId`

**Prevention**: Use consistent data fields across all components displaying vehicle information

#### Station View Shows "Location Required" Despite Fallback Location Set
**Problem**: Station view displays "Location Required - Please enable location services" even when fallback location is configured

**Root Cause**: StationDisplay component only checked GPS location, ignored fallback location hierarchy

**Solution**: Implemented proper location fallback logic in StationDisplay
- Created `getEffectiveLocation()` utility function with priority: GPS → Home → Work → Default → Cluj center
- Updated StationDisplay to use effective location instead of GPS-only location
- Added fallback location dependencies to React useMemo for proper updates

**Prevention**: Always use location fallback utilities instead of direct GPS location checks

#### Station View Shows Wrong Buses or No Buses
**Problem**: Station view shows buses that don't actually stop at the displayed stations, or shows no buses despite routes serving those stations

**Root Cause**: Using proximity-based filtering instead of proper GTFS trip_id matching
- Proximity approach shows buses that happen to be nearby but don't serve the station
- Missing proper trip_id filtering based on stop_times data

**Solution**: Implemented proper GTFS trip_id filtering approach
- **Step 1**: Get stop_times data to find which trips serve target stations
- **Step 2**: Extract trip_ids for trips that stop at these stations  
- **Step 3**: Filter live vehicles by those trip_ids only
- **Step 4**: Enrich with route information and display results
- **Added proper loading states** and debug logging for troubleshooting

**Technical Details**:
- Tranzy API `/opendata/stop_times` returns `trip_id`, `stop_id`, and `stop_sequence`
- 127 out of 130 vehicle trip_ids match with stop_times trip_ids
- Proper approach: Use trip_id relationships to show only buses that serve the stations
- Enriches vehicle data with route names and descriptions from `/opendata/routes`

**Prevention**: 
- Always use GTFS relationships (trip_id matching) instead of GPS proximity for station-vehicle associations
- Verify that vehicles actually serve the stations before displaying them
- Ensure each view triggers its own data refresh instead of relying on other components

#### Station View Shows Empty Despite API Data Available
**Problem**: Station view displays "No buses currently serve these stations" even though API calls are successful and return vehicle data

**Root Cause**: StationDisplay component was using `useEnhancedBusStore` which requires complex configuration and location setup, but the store was returning empty arrays due to initialization issues

**Symptoms**:
- API calls to `/stops`, `/routes`, and `/vehicles` are successful (200 status)
- Console shows stores returning `null` or empty arrays
- No `/stop_times` API calls being made
- Debug logs show `targetStationsLength: 0, vehiclesLength: 0`

**Solution**: Modified StationDisplay to fetch vehicle data directly instead of relying on enhanced bus store
- **Removed dependency** on `useEnhancedBusStore` which was designed for favorite buses
- **Added direct API calls** to fetch vehicles using `enhancedTranzyApi.getVehicles()`
- **Simplified data flow** from API → component state → processing → display
- **Fixed timing issues** by ensuring vehicle data is available before processing

**Technical Changes**:
- Replaced `useEnhancedBusStore` with direct `useState` for vehicles
- Added dedicated `fetchVehicles` useEffect for API calls
- Updated vehicle filtering to work with raw `Vehicle[]` data instead of `EnhancedVehicleInfo[]`
- Maintained proper trip_id filtering logic for station-vehicle matching

**Prevention**: 
- Use appropriate data sources for each component's needs
- Avoid complex store dependencies when simple API calls suffice
- Ensure data availability before processing in useEffect chains
- Test component isolation to verify data flow works independently

#### Station View Overcomplicated Vehicle Processing
**Problem**: Station view had complex GTFS sequence analysis that was slow and error-prone

**Root Cause**: Overcomplicated logic trying to determine vehicle arrival/departure status using sequence analysis

**Solution**: Simplified to basic vehicle-station relationship check
- **Simple Logic**: Station ID → Vehicle trip_id → Check if station is in trip's stops
- **Removed Complexity**: Eliminated route ID mapping, sequence analysis, arrival/departure logic
- **Direct Relationship**: Just show vehicles whose trips serve the closest station
- **Better Performance**: Much faster processing with fewer API calls

**Prevention**: Start with simple solutions before adding complexity

#### Station View Inefficient Vehicle Filtering
**Problem**: Station view was making individual API calls for each vehicle to check if it serves a station

**Root Cause**: Wrong approach - checking each vehicle's trip individually instead of bulk filtering

**Solution**: Implemented efficient bulk filtering approach
- **Step 1**: Get all stop_times once (bulk API call)
- **Step 2**: Filter stop_times by target station IDs to get relevant trip_ids
- **Step 3**: Filter vehicles by those trip_ids (in-memory filtering)
- **Result**: Much faster with fewer API calls

**Prevention**: Use bulk operations and in-memory filtering instead of individual API calls in loops

#### Station View Showing Stations with No Buses
**Problem**: Station view displays nearby stations (like "Test_CJ") that show "No buses currently at this station" message

**Root Cause**: Station filtering logic only considered distance proximity (within 2km) but didn't verify if any vehicles actually serve those stations

**Solution Applied (December 2024)**: Modified station display logic to only show stations with active bus service
- **Changed rendering approach**: Only display stations that have vehicles serving them (from `stationVehicleGroups`)
- **Removed "always show stations" logic**: Eliminated code that displayed all nearby stations regardless of bus service
- **Added vehicle-station validation**: Stations are only shown after confirming vehicles serve them via trip_id matching
- **Improved user experience**: Users no longer see empty stations, only stations with actual bus service

**Technical Changes**:
- Updated `StationDisplay.tsx` rendering logic to iterate over `stationVehicleGroups` instead of `targetStations`
- Added `.filter(Boolean)` to remove null entries from station list
- Modified station filtering to include preliminary vehicle proximity check (5km radius)
- Maintained proper distance information by cross-referencing with `targetStations`

**Prevention**: Always validate that displayed data has meaningful content for users before showing UI elements

#### Station View Not Updating After Cache Refresh
**Problem**: In the nearest station view, pressing the refresh button (top right) updates the cache but vehicles don't update their data until switching to favorites view and back

**Root Cause**: The `useVehicleProcessing` hook was fetching data directly from the API instead of subscribing to store updates. When the refresh button updates the store cache, the hook doesn't know about those updates because it's not listening to the store.

**Solution Applied (December 2024)**: Modified `useVehicleProcessing` hook to use store data instead of direct API calls
- **Added store subscription**: Hook now subscribes to `useEnhancedBusStore` for vehicle data
- **Converted store data**: Added logic to convert store vehicles to the format expected by the hook
- **Maintained fallback**: If no store data available, falls back to direct API calls
- **Added refresh trigger**: Hook triggers store refresh if data is older than 5 minutes
- **Fixed reactivity**: Vehicle data now updates immediately when store is refreshed

**Technical Changes**:
- Updated `useVehicleProcessing.ts` to import and use `useEnhancedBusStore`
- Added `storeVehicles`, `storeIsLoading`, and `lastUpdate` from store
- Modified vehicle fetching logic to convert store data to `LiveVehicle[]` format
- Added automatic store refresh trigger for stale data
- Updated loading states to include store loading state

**Prevention**: Always use store subscriptions instead of direct API calls when store data is available to ensure UI reactivity

#### Architecture Violation: Direct API Calls Bypassing Cache System
**Problem**: Multiple components and services making direct Tranzy API calls instead of using the cache-aware methods, undermining performance and causing unnecessary API requests

**Root Cause**: Components were calling `enhancedTranzyApi.getX()` methods without the `forceRefresh = false` parameter, or bypassing the cache system entirely

**Critical Violations Found**:
- **`useVehicleProcessing.ts`**: Direct calls to `getStops()`, `getVehicles()`, `getRoutes()`, `getStopTimes()`, `getTrips()`
- **Component layer**: `BusRouteMapModal.tsx`, `StationMapModal.tsx` bypassing cache for shape data
- **Service layer**: Multiple services bypassing cache in `agencyService.ts`, `routeMappingService.ts`, `favoriteBusService.ts`, `routePlanningService.ts`
- **Store layer**: `favoriteBusStore.ts` not using cache-aware route fetching
- **Performance impact**: Unnecessary API requests, slower response times, potential rate limiting

**Solution Applied (December 2024)**:
- **Fixed cache parameters**: Added explicit `forceRefresh = false` to all API calls that should use cache
- **Updated hook calls**: Modified `useVehicleProcessing` to use cache-aware methods
- **Service layer fixes**: Updated `agencyService` and `routeMappingService` to respect cache
- **Architecture enforcement**: All data access should go through cache-aware methods

**Technical Changes**:
- `useVehicleProcessing.ts`: All API calls now use `forceRefresh = false` parameter
- `agencyService.ts`: `getAgencies()` calls now use cache
- `routeMappingService.ts`: `getRoutes()` calls now use cache
- Added logging to distinguish cache vs fresh API calls

**Cache-Aware Method Signatures**:
```typescript
// ✅ Correct - uses cache by default
await enhancedTranzyApi.getStops(agencyId, false);
await enhancedTranzyApi.getRoutes(agencyId, false);
await enhancedTranzyApi.getVehicles(agencyId); // cache by default
await enhancedTranzyApi.getStopTimes(agencyId, undefined, undefined, false);

// ❌ Incorrect - bypasses cache
await enhancedTranzyApi.getStops(agencyId, true); // force refresh
```

**Architecture Rules**:
1. **Always use cache**: Default to `forceRefresh = false` unless explicitly refreshing
2. **Store-first**: Components should prefer store data over direct API calls
3. **Cache invalidation**: Only use `forceRefresh = true` in refresh actions
4. **Service layer**: Services must respect cache unless specifically refreshing data

**Prevention**: 
- Code review checklist: Verify all API calls use cache-aware parameters
- Prefer store subscriptions over direct API calls in components
- Use `forceRefresh = true` only in explicit refresh/update actions
- Monitor API request patterns to identify cache bypasses
- Removed conflicting default export

**Prevention**: Always use consistent export patterns (prefer named exports)

#### Console Log Level Not Updating
**Problem**: Changing console log level in configuration doesn't affect actual console output

**Root Cause**: Log level was only applied locally in component but not persisted to config store until entire configuration was submitted

**Solution**: Fixed immediate log level application
- Added `handleLogLevelChange` function that immediately updates both form data and config store
- Log level changes are now applied instantly when dropdown value changes
- Removed redundant useEffect that was trying to sync log level

**Prevention**: Ensure configuration changes that affect global state are persisted immediately, not just on form submission

#### Console Log Level Not Respected by Debug Messages
**Problem**: Setting console log level to WARN still shows DEBUG and INFO messages in console

**Root Cause**: Many debug messages were using `console.log()` directly instead of the logger system, bypassing log level filtering

**Solution**: Replaced direct console.log calls with proper logger calls
- Converted `console.log()` calls to `logger.debug()`, `logger.info()`, or `logger.warn()` as appropriate
- Debug messages now respect the configured log level setting
- Console output is now properly filtered based on user's log level preference

**Prevention**: Always use the logger system (`logger.debug()`, `logger.info()`, etc.) instead of direct `console.log()` calls

#### Repeated Google Maps API Key Warnings
**Problem**: Console shows repeated "Google Maps API key not configured" warnings every time transit calculations are performed

**Root Cause**: The Google Transit Service was checking for API key on every calculation and logging a warning each time, instead of checking once and remembering the result

**Solution**: Implemented smart API key checking with state caching
- Added `apiKeyChecked` and `hasApiKey` flags to remember API key status
- Only logs the warning once when first checking API key availability
- Subsequent calls use cached result without logging
- API key check resets when Google Maps API key configuration changes
- Changed warning level from WARN to INFO for less intrusive logging

**Prevention**: Cache expensive checks and avoid repeated logging of the same condition

#### Multiple Log Level Change Messages
**Problem**: Console shows repeated "Log level changed to: WARN" messages when managing favorite buses or other configuration changes

**Root Cause**: The config store was calling `setLogLevel()` on every `updateConfig()` call, even when the log level hadn't actually changed

**Solution**: Added log level change detection
- Only call `setLogLevel()` when the log level actually changes
- Check `currentConfig?.logLevel !== updatedConfig.logLevel` before setting
- Removed duplicate log level initialization from logger.ts
- Config store now handles all log level management

**Prevention**: Always check if a value has actually changed before triggering side effects

### App Won't Start

#### Port Already in Use
**Problem**: `Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::5175`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Use a different port
npm run dev -- --port 3000

# Or kill the process using the port
lsof -ti:5175 | xargs kill -9
```

#### Node Version Issues
**Problem**: `Error: The engine "node" is incompatible`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check your Node version
node --version

# Install Node 18+ if needed
# Using nvm (recommended):
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

### API Issues

#### "API Key Invalid" Error / 403 Forbidden
**Problem**: Can't fetch bus data, getting 403 Forbidden or API key rejected

**Root Cause**: API authentication is failing, but network connectivity is working

**Diagnostic Tool**: Open `tools/debug/check-api-status.html` in your browser to:
- Check if API key is stored correctly
- Test API calls with detailed error information
- Verify network connectivity vs API authentication

**Solutions**:
1. **Check API key format**: Ensure it's the correct format from Tranzy.ai
2. **Verify key permissions**: Log into Tranzy account and check key status
3. **Test key directly**: Use the diagnostic tool to test API calls
4. **Clear and re-enter**: Delete and re-enter the API key in Settings
5. **Check account status**: Ensure your Tranzy.ai account is active

**Enhanced Connectivity Tracking (December 2024)**: Online/offline indicator now shows actual API connectivity status:
- **Green "Online"**: Network connected AND API accessible
- **Red "Offline"**: No network connection
- **Red "API Error"**: Network connected but API unavailable (403, timeouts, etc.)

#### "No Schedule Data Available"
**Problem**: Routes show no departure times

**Root Cause**: This was a major issue caused by station name mismatches between CTP Cluj website and Tranzy API.

**Fixed**: The app now provides route-level timing for any station request, so this should no longer occur.

**If it still happens**:
1. **Refresh the page** - data might be temporarily unavailable
2. **Check route number** - ensure it's a valid CTP Cluj route
3. **Try different time** - some routes have limited schedules

#### CORS Errors
**Problem**: `Access to fetch at 'https://api.tranzy.ai' from origin 'http://localhost:5175' has been blocked by CORS policy`

**Solution**: This should be handled by the proxy configuration. If you see this:
1. **Restart the dev server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Check proxy config**: Verify `vite.config.ts` has correct proxy setup
3. **Clear browser cache**: Old requests might be cached

### Route & Schedule Issues

#### Route 42 Not Showing 15:45 Departure
**Problem**: Expected departure time missing from schedule

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Route 42 now includes 15:45 departure

**If still missing**:
1. **Check current time**: Schedule might be filtered by time of day
2. **Refresh data**: Pull down to refresh or wait for auto-refresh
3. **Verify route direction**: Make sure you're looking at the right direction

#### Wrong Route Numbers
**Problem**: Route shows as "40" instead of "42"

**Explanation**: 
- **Tranzy API uses Route ID**: "40"
- **CTP Cluj uses Route Label**: "42"
- **App should show**: "42" (the user-facing number)

**If showing wrong number**: This indicates a bug in the route mapping logic.

#### Live Tracking Not Working
**Problem**: No red dots showing live buses

**Possible Causes**:
1. **No buses currently running** - check if it's operating hours
2. **API key issues** - live data requires valid Tranzy API key
3. **Network issues** - check internet connection
4. **Route not supported** - not all routes have live tracking

### Test Failures

#### "useRefreshSystem() returns undefined"
**Problem**: RefreshControl tests failing

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Mock configuration corrected

**If tests still fail**:
```bash
# Clear test cache
npm run test -- --clearCache

# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm test
```

#### General Test Issues
```bash
# Run tests with verbose output
npm test -- --verbose

# Run specific test file
npm test -- RefreshControl.test.tsx

# Run tests in watch mode for debugging
npm run test:watch
```

### Performance Issues

#### Storage Quota Exceeded Error
**Problem**: Browser console shows "QuotaExceededError: The quota has been exceeded"

**Root Cause**: App cache grows too large for browser's localStorage limit (5-10MB)

**Solution Applied (December 2024)**: 
- **Intelligent cache management**: Monitors both total size and individual entry sizes
- **Large entry prevention**: Blocks individual entries over 2MB from being cached
- **Size-based cleanup**: Removes largest entries first (more effective than age-based)
- **Conservative limits**: Warning at 2MB, hard limit at 3MB (more aggressive prevention)
- **Enhanced emergency handling**: Keeps only 20 smallest entries if quota exceeded
- **Graceful fallback**: Continues working even if storage completely fails

**Manual Solutions**:
- **Clear browser data**: Go to browser settings and clear site data
- **Restart browser**: Sometimes helps reset storage quotas
- **Check available space**: Ensure device has sufficient storage

**Prevention**: Cache now self-manages storage size automatically

#### Slow Loading
**Solutions**:
1. **Check network speed** - app fetches data from multiple sources
2. **Clear browser cache** - old data might be causing conflicts
3. **Disable auto-refresh** - reduces background network activity
4. **Use WiFi** - mobile data might be slower

#### High Battery Usage
**Solutions**:
1. **Turn off auto-refresh** when not actively using
2. **Close unused browser tabs**
3. **Use airplane mode** when not needed
4. **Enable battery saver** in browser settings

### Browser-Specific Issues

#### Safari Issues
- **Location not working**: Check Safari location permissions
- **Service worker issues**: Try clearing Safari cache
- **Display problems**: Safari sometimes has CSS issues

#### Chrome Issues
- **Memory usage**: Chrome can use lots of RAM with auto-refresh
- **CORS in dev mode**: Make sure you're using `localhost:5175`

#### Mobile Browser Issues
- **Touch not working**: Try refreshing the page
- **Zoom issues**: Use pinch-to-zoom for better view
- **Add to home screen**: For better mobile experience

### Favorite Buses Data Issues

#### "Route information unavailable" or "No real-time data available"
**Problem**: Favorite buses show error messages instead of vehicle data

**Major Fix Applied (December 2024)**: Fixed Tranzy API vehicle lookup issue

**Root Cause**: Tranzy API vehicles endpoint design inconsistency:
- `/routes` endpoint: Uses internal route IDs (e.g., `route_id: 40` for `route_short_name: "42"`)
- `/vehicles` endpoint: Uses route short names in the route_id field (e.g., `route_id: "42"`)

**Solution Applied**: Modified `favoriteBusService.ts` to look up vehicles using route short names instead of internal route IDs.

**Verification**: Check console logs for:
- `🗺️ DEBUGGING: Route mapping found` with explanation about API design
- `🚌 DEBUGGING: Vehicle cache lookup results` showing `routesWithVehicles` populated
- Route correction showing proper vehicle lookup strategy

**Debugging Steps Using DevTools**:

1. **Open Browser DevTools** (F12 or right-click → Inspect)

2. **Go to Console Tab** and look for debugging messages with these prefixes:
   - `🔍 DEBUGGING: Agency lookup` - Check if agency ID is found
   - `🗺️ DEBUGGING: Route mapping found` - Check if route mapping works
   - `🔄 DEBUGGING: Route correction summary` - See route ID corrections
   - `🚛 DEBUGGING: Raw vehicles received` - Check if vehicles are fetched from API
   - `🚛 DEBUGGING: Vehicle filtering results` - See how many vehicles pass filtering
   - `🚌 DEBUGGING: Vehicle cache lookup results` - Check final vehicle availability

3. **Common Issues & Solutions**:

   **Agency Not Found**:
   ```
   ❌ No agency found for city: Cluj-Napoca
   ```
   **Solution**: Check API key configuration and city name

   **Route Mapping Failed**:
   ```
   ❌ DEBUGGING: No route mapping found for favorite route: {routeName: "42"}
   ```
   **Solution**: Route "42" doesn't exist in API. Check available routes in Settings.

   **No Vehicles with Valid Trip IDs**:
   ```
   🚛 DEBUGGING: Vehicle filtering results: {
     totalVehicles: 150,
     activeVehicles: 0,
     filteredOut: 150,
     filterReasons: {noTripId: 145, noRouteId: 5}
   }
   ```
   **Solution**: All vehicles have `tripId: null`, indicating operational issues. This is correct behavior - the route has no active vehicles with proper GTFS data.

   **Route ID Mismatch**:
   ```
   🚌 DEBUGGING: Vehicle cache lookup results: {
     requestedRoutes: ["123"],
     routesWithVehicles: ["456", "789"],
     vehicleBreakdown: []
   }
   ```
   **Solution**: Requested route ID "123" doesn't match available vehicle route IDs. Check route mapping service.

4. **Manual Testing Steps**:

   **Check Raw API Data**:
   - Open Network tab in DevTools
   - Look for requests to `/api/tranzy/v1/opendata/vehicles`
   - Check response to see if vehicles have `trip_id` values
   - Vehicles with `trip_id: null` are filtered out (this is correct)

   **Check Route Mapping**:
   - Look for requests to route mapping service
   - Verify route "42" maps to correct API route ID
   - Check if mapped route ID exists in vehicle data

   **Check Configuration**:
   - Go to Application tab → Local Storage
   - Look for `config-store` entry
   - Verify `favoriteBuses` array contains correct route names
   - Verify `agencyId` is set (should be "2" for Cluj)

5. **Expected Behavior**:
   - **If no vehicles have valid `trip_id`**: "Route information unavailable" is correct
   - **If route mapping fails**: Route doesn't exist in current GTFS data
   - **If agency lookup fails**: API key or configuration issue

#### Performance Issues with Favorite Buses
**Problem**: Favorite buses take long time to load or cause app to freeze

**Debugging**: Check console for:
- Multiple rapid API calls (indicates caching issues)
- Large vehicle datasets being processed
- Memory usage in DevTools Performance tab

**Solution**: 
- Verify cache is working properly
- Check if auto-refresh intervals are too aggressive
- Ensure proper cleanup of subscriptions

#### Cache Issues
**Problem**: Favorite buses show stale data or don't update

**Debugging**: Look for cache-related logs:
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Cache age information
- Force refresh triggers

**Solution**:
- Clear browser cache and localStorage
- Check cache TTL settings
- Verify auto-refresh is working

### PWA & Mobile Issues

#### Dark Mode Not Persisting in PWA (iPhone Add to Home Screen)
**Problem**: Dark mode setting doesn't stay when exiting and re-entering the browser/PWA

**Root Cause**: Theme persistence issues in PWA mode due to localStorage timing and theme flash prevention

**Solution Applied (December 2024)**:
- **Enhanced theme store persistence**: Changed storage key to `cluj-bus-theme` for better PWA isolation
- **Immediate theme application**: Added `onRehydrateStorage` callback to apply theme immediately on load
- **Document root theme attribute**: Added `data-theme` attribute to prevent theme flash
- **PWA meta theme-color**: Dynamic theme-color meta tag updates based on current theme
- **Theme initialization**: Improved theme detection and application on app startup

**Technical Changes**:
- Updated `themeStore.ts` with better PWA persistence
- Added theme initialization in `main.tsx` with React useEffect
- Updated `manifest.json` and `index.html` with correct theme colors
- Added document-level theme attributes for consistent theming

**Prevention**: Always test PWA functionality on actual mobile devices, not just desktop browser dev tools

#### GPS Location Not Refreshing on Manual Refresh
**Problem**: Pressing the refresh button doesn't update GPS location for user

**Root Cause**: Location refresh logic was checking permission status instead of always attempting fresh location

**Solution Applied (December 2024)**:
- **Always attempt GPS refresh**: Modified RefreshControl to always try location refresh regardless of permission status
- **Force fresh location**: Set `maximumAge: 0` in geolocation options to prevent cached location
- **Increased timeout**: Extended GPS timeout to 20 seconds for better reliability
- **Better error handling**: Improved GPS error logging while continuing with data refresh

**Technical Changes**:
- Updated `RefreshControl.tsx` to always call `requestLocation()`
- Modified `LocationService.getCurrentPosition()` to force fresh location
- Added better GPS refresh logging for debugging
- Maintained graceful fallback when GPS fails

**Prevention**: Test location refresh on actual mobile devices with GPS enabled

#### PWA Theme Color Not Matching App Theme
**Problem**: PWA status bar color doesn't match the app's current theme (light/dark)

**Solution Applied**: 
- Updated `manifest.json` theme_color to match Material Design primary color
- Added dynamic meta theme-color updates in `main.tsx`
- Updated `index.html` meta theme-color to correct value

**Prevention**: Keep PWA manifest colors in sync with app theme colors

### Service Worker & Caching Issues

#### App Shows Old Content After Deployment / Blue Screen / Update Not Working
**Problem**: After deploying a new version, users see:
- Old content that doesn't match the new deployment
- Blue screen or broken display
- "Check for updates" in settings doesn't trigger version update
- Browser cache seems stuck on old version

**Root Cause**: Service worker caching strategy issues and version management problems

**Comprehensive Solution (December 2024)**:

**1. Immediate Fix for Users**:
```bash
# Force complete cache clear (for developers)
# In browser DevTools Console:
caches.keys().then(names => Promise.all(names.map(name => caches.delete(name)))).then(() => location.reload())

# Or manually:
# 1. Open DevTools (F12)
# 2. Go to Application tab
# 3. Click "Storage" in left sidebar
# 4. Click "Clear site data"
# 5. Refresh page (Cmd+R / Ctrl+R)
```

**2. For Developers - Proper Deployment Process**:
```bash
# CRITICAL: Always run version update before deployment
node scripts/update-version.js    # Updates SW version and HTML meta tag
npm run build                     # Build with new version
# Deploy to production
```

**3. Root Cause Analysis**:

The issue stems from multiple service worker problems:

**Problem A: Service Worker Cache Strategy**
- Service worker uses cache-first strategy for static assets
- Old cached content served even when new version deployed
- `skipWaiting()` and `clients.claim()` not working effectively

**Problem B: Version Management**
- Version only updated in SW and HTML meta tag
- No mechanism to force cache invalidation on version mismatch
- Update detection relies on SW update events that may not fire

**Problem C: Update Notification System**
- Update detection depends on SW `updatefound` event
- Event may not fire if SW doesn't detect changes
- Manual "check for updates" doesn't force cache clear

**4. Technical Solutions Applied**:

**Enhanced Service Worker Strategy**:
- Modified SW to use network-first in development
- Added aggressive cache clearing on version mismatch
- Improved `skipWaiting()` and `clients.claim()` implementation

**Better Version Detection**:
- Added version comparison between SW and HTML meta tag
- Force cache clear when versions don't match
- Enhanced update notification system

**Improved Update Process**:
- "Check for updates" now forces cache clear
- Better error handling for update failures
- More reliable update detection

**5. Prevention Strategies**:

**For Developers**:
- Always run `node scripts/update-version.js` before deployment
- Test update process in production-like environment
- Verify version numbers match across SW, HTML, and package.json

**For Users**:
- Use "Check for updates" in Settings when issues occur
- Clear browser cache if problems persist
- Refresh page after seeing update notification

**6. Debug Information**:

Check browser console for these messages:
```
✅ Service Worker updated to version: 2025-12-16-1430
✅ All caches cleared
✅ Service Worker activated, claiming clients...
```

If you see errors like:
```
❌ Failed to check for updates
❌ Service Worker registration failed
```

This indicates a deeper service worker issue requiring manual cache clear.

**7. Emergency Recovery**:

If app is completely broken:
```bash
# Complete reset (in browser console)
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(registrations => {
  registrations.forEach(registration => registration.unregister())
}).then(() => {
  caches.keys().then(names => Promise.all(names.map(name => caches.delete(name))))
}).then(() => location.reload())
```

**8. Monitoring & Verification**:

After deployment, verify:
- Version number in Settings matches deployment
- No console errors related to service worker
- App content reflects latest changes
- Update notification system works

**Prevention**: This comprehensive solution addresses the core caching issues and provides multiple recovery paths for users experiencing update problems.
