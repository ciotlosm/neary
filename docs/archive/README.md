## Why Archived?

The original documentation structure had:
- **Too many files** - Over 50 separate markdown files
- **Duplicate information** - Same concepts explained multiple times
- **Hard to navigate** - Difficult to find relevant information
- **Outdated content** - Some files contained obsolete information

## New Structure

The consolidated documentation is now organized as:
- **[getting-started.md](../getting-started.md)** - Setup and installation
- **[user-guide.md](../user-guide.md)** - How to use the app
- **[developer-guide.md](../developer-guide.md)** - Technical details
- **[troubleshooting.md](../troubleshooting.md)** - Problem solving
- **[changelog.md](../changelog.md)** - Recent changes
